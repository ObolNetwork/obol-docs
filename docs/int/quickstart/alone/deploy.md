description: Move the private key shares to the nodes and run the cluster
---

# Deploy the cluster
To distribute your cluster physically and start the DV, copy or move each `.charon` directory with one (or several) private key shares within it to the other machines you'll use as nodes. 

:point_right: Use the single node [docker compose](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node), the kubernetes [manifests](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-k8s-distributed-validator-node), or the [helm chart](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/helm-charts) example repos to get your nodes up and connected after loading the `.charon` folder artifacts into them appropriately.

:::warning
Right now, the `charon-distributed-node-cluster` repo [used earlier to create the private keys](./create-keys) outputs a folder structure like `.charon/ cluster/node0/validator_keys`. Make sure to grab the `./node0/*` folder, RENAME it to `.charon` and then move it to one of the single node repo above to have a working cluster.
