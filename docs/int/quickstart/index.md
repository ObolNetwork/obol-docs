# Quickstart Guides

:::caution
Charon is in an early alpha state and is not ready to be run on mainnet
:::

There are two ways to run a distributed validator and each comes with its own quickstart
1. [Run a DV cluster with a **group** of other node operators](./group/index.md), where you each run only one validator client and charon client, and the charon clients communicate with one another over the public internet to operate the distributed validator.
2. [Run a DV cluster **alone**](./quickstart-alone.md), by running all of the required software as containers within docker.
