# Walkthough guides

Walkthough guides for beginner users. These guides are specific to hardware and operating system setups, and cannot but used in place of more general documentation. However, they contain more detailed step-by-step information which may be useful for beginner users with limited experience with Linux, validators, and other topics which the docs assume as pre-requisites. 

Some of these guides are community-created, and may contain errors. These guides should be regarded as seperate from the official documentation, and not a replacement for the quickstart guides, for example.
