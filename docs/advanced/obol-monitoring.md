# Push Metrics to Obol Monitoring

:::info
This is **optional** and does not confer any special privileges within the Obol Network.

You may have been provided with **Monitoring Credentials** used to push distributed validator metrics to Obol's central Prometheus cluster to monitor, analyze, and improve your Distributed Validator Cluster's performance. (For example, this is necessary to participate in the Obol [Techne](https://squadstaking.com/techne) credential program.) 

## Update the monitoring token in the `.env` file  
- Inside your `.env` file, uncomment the `PROM_REMOTE_WRITE_TOKEN` line by removing the `#` symbol.  
- Enter your monitoring token in the format shown below:

```shell
PROM_REMOTE_WRITE_TOKEN=your_monitoring_token
```

## Save the `.env` file and restart Prometheus  
Save the .env file, and restart Prometheus to apply the changes:

```shell
docker compose restart prometheus
```

The last step in your DappNode setup is to add your Monitoring Credentials. This allows you to push distributed validator metrics to Obolâ€™s central Prometheus cluster for monitoring, analysis, and performance optimization of your Distributed Validator Cluster. It also facilitates easier troubleshooting with the Obol team when needed.

<ol>
  <li>Get Prometheus credentials from Obol, which will look like:
    <pre><code>obol20tnt8UC...</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to your Obol package in DappNode and go to the Config tab.

  <li>At the bottom of the page, add the credential token under **Prometheus Monitoring Credentials (optional)**, then click the Update button.
  </li>
  <li>Return to the Info tab, scroll down to the Containers section, and click the down arrow to view all container statuses. If the Prometheus container is stopped, please restart it.
