# P2P interface

The Charon P2P interface loosely follows the [Eth2 beacon P2P interface](https://github.com/ethereum/consensus-specs/blob/dev/specs/phase0/p2p-interface.md).

- Transport: TCP over IPv4/IPv6.
- Handshake: [noise-libp2p](https://github.com/libp2p/specs/tree/master/noise) with `secp256k1` keys.
  - Nodes must have their keys authorized in a [cluster manifest](./08_distributed-validator-cluster-manifest.md) in order for the handshake to succeed.
