# Run a cluster with others

:::warning Charon is in an early alpha state and is not ready to be run on mainnet :::

There are two user journeys when setting up a DV cluster with others. Each comes with its own quickstart

1. The [**Leader** & **Creator** Journey](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/obol-docs/blob/main/versioned_docs/version-v0.14.4/int/quickstart/group/group/quickstart-group-leader-creator/README.md) which outlines the steps to create a cluster configuration for a cluster to be later joined by others.
   * In the **Leader** case, the person creating the cluster _will_ be a node operator in the cluster.
   * In the **Creator** case, the person creating the cluster _will not_ be a node operator in the cluster.
2. The [**Operator** Journey](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/obol-docs/blob/main/versioned_docs/version-v0.14.4/int/quickstart/group/group/quickstart-group-operator/README.md) which outlines the steps to join an existing cluster created by a leader or creator using the above process.
