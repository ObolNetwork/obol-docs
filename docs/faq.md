# ❓ FAQ

### Does Obol have a token

No. Distributed validators use only ether.

### Can I keep my existing validator client?

Yes. Charon sits as a middleware between a validator client and it's beacon node. All validators that implement the standard REST API will be supported, along with all popular client delivery software such as DAppNode [packages](https://dappnode.github.io/explorer/#/), Rocket Pool's [smart node](https://github.com/rocket-pool/smartnode), StakeHouse's [wagyu](https://github.com/stake-house/wagyu), and Stereum's [node launcher](https://stereum.net/development/#roadmap).

### Can I migrate my existing validator into a distributed validator?

It will be possible to split an existing validator keystore into a set of key shares suitable for a distributed validator, but it is a trusted distribution process, and if the old staking system is not safely shut down, it could pose a risk of double signing alongside the new distributed validator.

In an ideal scenario, a distributed validator's private key should never exist in full in a single location.
