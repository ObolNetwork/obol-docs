# The OBOL Token

The OBOL Token is central to the governance and operation of the Obol Collective. It serves multiple purposes that are essential to its functioning. 

### Token Contract

The official token contract address of the OBOL Token is [0x0B010000b7624eb9B3DfBC279673C76E9D29D5F7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0B010000b7624eb9B3DfBC279673C76E9D29D5F7).

### Token Supply

The total supply is capped at 500 million tokens. The full supply is not immediately circulating and tokens will unlock over the coming months and years. Please see the [airdrop announcement](http://blog.obol.org/airdrop/) for more details. 

### Token Utility

1. **Token Governance:** OBOL Token holders delegate their voting power to delegates who participate in the Token House decision-making processes. This includes voting on proposals affecting the Obol Collectiveâ€™s direction, upgrades, and funding allocations. Read more about the Token House [here](./token-house.md). 

2. **Obol Retroactive Funding (RAF):** Token holders delegate their voting power to Delegates, who vote on the projects eligible for retroactive funding. Read more about the Obol RAF [here](./raf.md). 

3. **DeFi:** Plans are in place to launch several DeFi avenues for the OBOL Token post-TGE, such as liquidity pools and lending protocols.

4. **More Utility Coming Soon:** Via governance proposals, the Obol community can add more functionality to the OBOL Token, for example a staking program, or integration with other staking or restaking applications.
