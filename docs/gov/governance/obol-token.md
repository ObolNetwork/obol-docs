# The OBOL Token

The OBOL Token is central to the governance and operation of the Obol Collective. It serves multiple purposes that are essential to its functioning. 

### Token Contract

The official token contract address of the OBOL Token is [0x0B010000b7624eb9B3DfBC279673C76E9D29D5F7](https://etherscan.io/address/0x0B010000b7624eb9B3DfBC279673C76E9D29D5F7).

### Token Supply

The total supply is capped at 500 million tokens. The full supply is not immediately circulating - tokens will unlock over the coming months and years, but the total supply will never exceed 500 million tokens. Please see the [airdrop announcement](http://blog.obol.org/airdrop/) for more details. 

### Token Utility

1. **Token Governance:** OBOL Token holders delegate their voting power to delegates who participate in the Token House decision-making processes. This includes voting on proposals affecting the Obol Collective’s direction, upgrades, and funding allocations. Read more about the Token House [here](./token-house.md). 

2. **Obol Retroactive Funding (RAF):** Token holders delegate their voting power to Delegates, who vote on the projects eligible for retroactive funding. Read more about the Obol RAF [here](./raf.md). 

3. **DeFi:** Plans are in place to launch several DeFi avenues for the OBOL Token post-TGE, such as liquidity pools and lending protocols.

4. **More Utility Coming Soon:** Via governance proposals, the Obol community can add more functionality to the OBOL Token, for example a staking program, or integration with other staking or restaking applications.
