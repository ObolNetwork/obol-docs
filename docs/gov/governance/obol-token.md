# The OBOL Token

The OBOL Token is central to the governance and operation of the Obol Collective. It serves multiple purposes that are essential to its functioning.

### Token Utility

1. **Token Governance:** OBOL Token holders delegate their voting power to delegates who participate in the Token House decision-making processes. This includes voting on proposals affecting the Obol Collectiveâ€™s direction, upgrades, and funding allocations. Read more about the Token House [here](./token-house.md). 

2. **Obol Retroactive Funding (RAF):** Token holders delegate their voting power to Delegates, who vote on the projects eligible for retroactive funding. Read more about the Obol RAF [here](./raf.md). 

3. **DeFi:** Plans are in place to launch several DeFi avenues for the OBOL Token post-TGE, such as liquidity pools and lending protocols.

4. **More Utility Coming Soon:** Via governance proposals, the Obol community add more functionality to the Obol token, for example a staking program, or integration with other staking or restaking applications.
