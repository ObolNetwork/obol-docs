# Delegate Guide

## Delegate Rules of Engagement

This document outlines the expectations, responsibilities, and values that should guide interactions within the Obol Collective governance community, including the Obol Forum, Discord, and working group meetings. This Code of Conduct will be reviewed periodically to incorporate feedback and adapt to governance needs. Any changes require community approval through the governance process.

Please review these principles carefully to ensure alignment with the Obol Collective’s vision and commitment to a decentralized and sustainable ecosystem.

Please read the rules of engagement on the forum [here](https://community.obol.org/t/delegates-rules-of-engagement/206).

## **Governance Toolkit**

These tools or their uses may change over time as governance evolves. For example, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance may be developed. Likewise, while voting currently takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract, some successful votes are administered and implemented by the Obol Association, which should not be the case indefinitely.

Please see the toolkit on the forum [here](https://community.obol.org/t/governance-toolkit/207).

### How to evaluate projects

Allocating funding is not a perfect process. You may not feel like an expert on a given project, or it may be challenging to directly compare projects’ impact. Here are some considerations to use throughout the process. 

- **Don’t fake expertise. You are voting for *you* — not for all of the Collective.**
    You are not individually responsible for knowing everything about every Obol RAF category. Some delegates may be experts in education, while others may be deeply experienced in technical infrastructure. We urge you to share your expertise with others, and where necessary, relying on the expertise of other trusted contributors.
    
- **Make sense together**
    Feel free to engage with other contributors and the broader Obol Collective in evaluating project impact.
    
- **Make holistic impact determinations, but when in doubt, don’t make assumptions.**
    A combination of data and research should leave you qualified to make an informed decision about a given applicant. Still, there might be some projects whose impact argument is more subjective and hard to quantify (in the education category, for example). Use your gut in these situations, but don’t be *too* charitable with an applicant. If an impact statement seems like a stretch, it probably is.
