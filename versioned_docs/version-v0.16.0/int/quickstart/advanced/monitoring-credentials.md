# Push metrics to Obol Monitoring

:::info
This is **optional** and does not confer any special privileges within the Obol Network.
:::

You may have been provided with **Monitoring Credentials** used to push distributed validator metrics to Obol's central prometheus cluster to monitor, analyze, and improve your Distributed Validator Cluster's performance.

The provided credentials needs to be added in `prometheus/prometheus.yml` replacing `$PROM_REMOTE_WRITE_TOKEN` and will look like:
```
obol20!tnt8U!C...
```

The updated `prometheus/prometheus.yml` file should look like:
```
global:
  scrape_interval:     30s # Set the scrape interval to every 30 seconds.
  evaluation_interval: 30s # Evaluate rules every 30 seconds.

remote_write:
  - url: https://vm.monitoring.gcp.obol.tech/write
    authorization:
      credentials: obol20!tnt8U!C...
