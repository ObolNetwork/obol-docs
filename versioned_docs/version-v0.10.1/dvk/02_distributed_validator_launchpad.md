# Distributed Validator launchpad

![DV Launchpad Promo Image](/img/DistributeYourValidators.svg)

In order to activate an Ethereum validator, 32 ETH must be deposited into the official deposit contract. 

The vast majority of users that created validators to date have used the **[~~Eth2~~ Staking Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/)**, a public good open source website built by the Ethereum Foundation alongside participants that later went on to found Obol. This tool has been wildly successful in the safe and educational creation of a significant number of validators on the Ethereum mainnet.

To facilitate the generation of distributed validator keys amongst remote users with high trust, the Obol Network intends to develop and maintain a website that enables a group of users to come together and create these threshold keys. 

The DV Launchpad is being developed over a number of phases, coordinated by our [DV launchpad working group](../int/working-groups), To participate in this effort, read through the page and sign up at the appropriate link.
