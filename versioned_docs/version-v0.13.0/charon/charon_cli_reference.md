# CLI reference

:::caution

The `charon` client is under heavy development, interfaces are subject to change until a first major version is published. 

:::

The following is a reference for charon version [`v0.13.0`](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases/tag/v0.13.0). Find the latest release on [our Github](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases).

The following are the top-level commands available to use. 

```markdown
charon help
Charon enables the operation of Ethereum validators in a fault tolerant manner by splitting the validating keys across a group of trusted parties using threshold cryptography.

Usage:
  charon [command]

Available Commands:
  bootnode    Start a discv5 bootnode server. Deprecated, use 'charon relay'
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  create      Create artifacts for a distributed validator cluster
  dkg         Participate in a Distributed Key Generation ceremony
  enr         Prints a new ENR for this node
  help        Help about any command
  relay       Start a libp2p relay server
  run         Run the charon middleware client
  version     Print version and exit

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for charon

Use "charon [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## The `create` subcommand

The `create` subcommand handles the creation of artifacts needed by charon to operate.

```markdown
charon create --help
Create artifacts for a distributed validator cluster. These commands can be used to facilitate the creation of a distributed validator cluster between a group of operators by performing a distributed key generation ceremony, or they can be used to create a local cluster for single operator use cases.

Usage:
  charon create [command]

Available Commands:
  cluster     Create private keys and configuration files needed to run a distributed validator cluster locally
  dkg         Create the configuration for a new Distributed Key Generation ceremony using charon dkg
  enr         Create an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) private key to identify this charon client

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for create

Use "charon create [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Creating an ENR for charon

An `enr` is an Ethereum Node Record. It is used to identify this charon client to its other counterparty charon clients across the internet. 

```markdown
charon create enr --help
Create an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) private key to identify this charon client

Usage:
  charon create enr [flags]

Flags:
      --data-dir string                The directory where charon will store all its internal data (default ".charon")
  -h, --help                           Help for enr
      --p2p-allowlist string           Comma-separated list of CIDR subnets for allowing only certain peer connections. Example: 192.168.0.0/16 would permit connections to peers on your local network only. The default is to accept all connections.
      --p2p-bootnode-relay             Enables using bootnodes as libp2p circuit relays. Useful if some charon nodes are not publicly accessible. Deprecated, should always be enabled. (default true)
      --p2p-bootnodes strings          Comma-separated list of discv5 bootnode URLs or ENRs. Deprecated, use p2p-relays flag.
      --p2p-bootnodes-from-lockfile    Enables using cluster lock ENRs as discv5 bootnodes. Allows skipping explicit bootnodes if key generation ceremony included correct IPs. Discv5 is deprecated, use relay discovery.
      --p2p-denylist string            Comma-separated list of CIDR subnets for disallowing certain peer connections. Example: 192.168.0.0/16 would disallow connections to peers on your local network. The default is to accept all connections.
      --p2p-disable-reuseport          Disables TCP port reuse for outgoing libp2p connections.
      --p2p-external-hostname string   The DNS hostname advertised by libp2p. This may be used to advertise an external DNS.
      --p2p-external-ip string         The IP address advertised by libp2p. This may be used to advertise an external IP.
      --p2p-relays strings             Comma-separated list of libp2p relay URLs or ENRs. (default [http://bootnode.lb.gcp.obol.tech:3640/enr])
      --p2p-tcp-address strings        Comma-separated list of listening TCP addresses (ip and port) for libP2P traffic. Empty default doesn't bind to local port therefore only supports outgoing connections.
      --p2p-udp-address string         Listening UDP address (ip and port) for discv5 discovery. Empty default disables discv5 discovery. Discv5 is deprecated, use relay discovery.

```

### Create a full cluster locally

`charon create cluster` creates a set of distributed validators locally, including the private keys, a `cluster-lock.json` file, and deposit and exit data. However, this command should only be used for solo use of distributed validators. To run a Distributed Validator with a group of operators, it is preferable to create these artifacts using the `charon dkg` command. That way, no single operator custodies all of the private keys to a distributed validator.

```markdown
charon create cluster --help
Creates a local charon cluster configuration including validator keys, charon p2p keys, cluster-lock.json and a deposit-data.json. See flags for supported features.

Usage:
  charon create cluster [flags]

  -t, --threshold int                  Optional override of threshold required for signature reconstruction. Defaults to ceil(n*2/3) if zero. Warning, non-default values decrease security.
      --withdrawal-address string      Withdrawal Ethereum address (default "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000")

```

## The `dkg` subcommand

### Performing a DKG Ceremony

Th `charon dkg` command takes a `cluster_definition.json` file that instructs charon on the terms of a new distributed validator cluster to be created. Charon establishes communication with the other nodes identified in the file, performs a distributed key generation ceremony to create the required threshold private keys, and signs deposit data for each new distributed validator. The command outputs the `cluster-lock.json` file and key shares for each Distributed Validator created. 

```markdown
charon dkg --help
Participate in a distributed key generation ceremony for a specific cluster definition that creates
distributed validator key shares and a final cluster lock configuration. Note that all other cluster operators should run
this command at the same time.

## Host a relay

Relays run a libp2p [circuit relay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/circuit-relay/) server that allows charon clusters to perform peer discovery and for charon clients behind NAT gateways to be communicated with. If you want to self-host a relay for your cluster(s) the following command will start one.

```markdown

      --monitoring-address string      Listening address (ip and port) for the prometheus and pprof monitoring http server. (default "127.0.0.1:3620")
      --p2p-allowlist string           Comma-separated list of CIDR subnets for allowing only certain peer connections. Example: 192.168.0.0/16 would permit connections to peers on your local network only. The default is to accept all connections.

      --p2p-bootnodes strings          Comma-separated list of discv5 bootnode URLs or ENRs. Deprecated, use p2p-relays flag.
      --p2p-bootnodes-from-lockfile    Enables using cluster lock ENRs as discv5 bootnodes. Allows skipping explicit bootnodes if key generation ceremony included correct IPs. Discv5 is deprecated, use relay discovery.
      --p2p-denylist string            Comma-separated list of CIDR subnets for disallowing certain peer connections. Example: 192.168.0.0/16 would disallow connections to peers on your local network. The default is to accept all connections.

      --p2p-udp-address string         Listening UDP address (ip and port) for discv5 discovery. Empty default disables discv5 discovery. Discv5 is deprecated, use relay discovery.

```

## Host a bootnode (deprecated)

Bootnodes are dual-purpose at this point in time. They run a [discV5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md) discovery server that allows charon clients to find one another despite IP address changes, and they also run a libp2p [circuit relay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/circuit-relay/) server that allows charon clients behind NAT gateways to be communicated with when `--p2p-bootnode-relay` is enabled. These features make it easier to get a distributed validator cluster established and connected, but they trade off against cluster independence and fault tolerance. In the long run the use of these features will be minimised, but for now, if you want to self-host a bootnode for your cluster(s) the following command will start one. 

```markdown
