# CLI reference

The following is a reference for Charon version [`v1.1.2`](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases/tag/v1.1.2). Find the latest release on [our Github](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases).

The following are the top-level commands available to use.

```markdown
charon --help
Charon enables the operation of Ethereum validators in a fault tolerant manner by splitting the validating keys across a group of trusted parties using threshold cryptography.

Usage:
  charon [command]

Available Commands:
  alpha       Alpha subcommands provide early access to in-development features
  combine     Combine the private key shares of a distributed validator cluster into a set of standard validator private keys
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  create      Create artifacts for a distributed validator cluster
  dkg         Participate in a Distributed Key Generation ceremony
  enr         Print the ENR that identifies this client
  exit        Exit a distributed validator.
  help        Help about any command
  relay       Start a libp2p relay server
  run         Run the charon middleware client
  version     Print version and exit

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for charon

Use "charon [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## The `create` command

The `create` command handles the creation of artifacts needed by Charon to operate.

```markdown
charon create --help
Create artifacts for a distributed validator cluster. These commands can be used to facilitate the creation of a distributed validator cluster between a group of operators by performing a distributed key generation ceremony, or they can be used to create a local cluster for single operator use cases.

Usage:
  charon create [command]

Available Commands:
  cluster     Create private keys and configuration files needed to run a distributed validator cluster locally
  dkg         Create the configuration for a new Distributed Key Generation ceremony using charon dkg
  enr         Create an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) private key to identify this charon client

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for create

Use "charon create [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Creating an ENR for Charon

An `enr` is an Ethereum Node Record. It is used to identify this Charon client to its other counterparty Charon clients across the internet.

```markdown
charon create enr --help
Create an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) private key to identify this charon client

Usage:
  charon create enr [flags]

Flags:
      --data-dir string   The directory where charon will store all its internal data. (default ".charon")
  -h, --help              Help for enr
```

### Create a full cluster locally

The `charon create cluster` command creates a set of distributed validators locally; including the private keys, a `cluster-lock.json` file, and deposit data. This command should only be used for solo-operation of distributed validators. To run a distributed validator cluster with a group of operators, it is preferable to create these artifacts using the [DV Launchpad](../dvl/intro.md) and the `charon dkg` command. That way, no single operator custodies all of the private keys to a distributed validator.

:::warning
This command produces new distributed validator private keys or handles and splits pre-existing traditional validator private keys, please use caution and keep these private keys securely backed up and secret.
:::

```markdown

## The `dkg` command

### Performing a DKG Ceremony

The `charon dkg` command takes a `cluster_definition.json` file that instructs Charon on the terms of a new distributed validator cluster to be created. Charon establishes communication with the other nodes identified in the file, performs a distributed key generation ceremony to create the required threshold private keys, and signs deposit data for each new distributed validator. The command outputs the `cluster-lock.json` file and key shares for each Distributed Validator created.

```markdown
charon dkg --help
Participate in a distributed key generation ceremony for a specific cluster definition that creates
distributed validator key shares and a final cluster lock configuration. Note that all other cluster operators should run
this command at the same time.

## The `exit` command

A running Charon client will [aggregate and broadcast](../start/quickstart-exit.mdx) signed exit messages it receives from its validator client immediately. These `exit` commands are instead used to *pre-sign* exit messages for an active distributed validator, to save to disk, or to broadcast; once enough of the operators of the cluster have submitted their partial exit signatures. Fully signed exit messages give a user or protocol a guarantee that they can exit an active validator at any point in future without the further assistance of the cluster's operators. In future, [execution-layer initiated exits](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7002) will provide an even stronger guarantee that a validator can be exited by the withdrawal address it belongs to.

```markdown
charon exit --help
Sign and broadcast distributed validator exit messages using a remote API.

Usage:
  charon exit [command]

Available Commands:
  active-validator-list List all active validators
  broadcast             Submit partial exit message for a distributed validator
  fetch                 Fetch a signed exit message from the remote API
  sign                  Sign partial exit message for a distributed validator

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for exit

Use "charon exit [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Pre-sign exit messages for active validators

:::warning
This command requires Charon to access the distributed validator's private keys, please use caution and keep these private keys securely backed up and secret.

The default `publish-address` for this command sends signed exit messages to Obol's [API](/api) for aggregation and distribution. Exit signatures are stored in line with Obol's [terms and contiditions](https://obol.tech/terms.pdf).
:::

This command submits partial exit signatures to the remote API for aggregation. The required flags are `--beacon-node-url` and `--validator-public-key` of the validator you wish to exit. An exit message can only be signed for a validator that is fully deposited and assigned a validator index.

```markdown
charon exit sign --help
Sign a partial exit message for a distributed validator and submit it to a remote API for aggregation.

Usage:
  charon exit sign [flags]

Flags:
      --beacon-node-endpoints strings   Comma separated list of one or more beacon node endpoint URLs. [REQUIRED]
      --beacon-node-timeout duration    Timeout for beacon node HTTP calls. (default 30s)
      --exit-epoch uint                 Exit epoch at which the validator will exit, must be the same across all the partial exits. (default 162304)
  -h, --help                            Help for sign
      --lock-file string                The path to the cluster lock file defining the distributed validator cluster. (default ".charon/cluster-lock.json")
      --log-color string                Log color; auto, force, disable. (default "auto")
      --log-format string               Log format; console, logfmt or json (default "console")
      --log-level string                Log level; debug, info, warn or error (default "info")
      --log-output-path string          Path in which to write on-disk logs.
      --private-key-file string         The path to the charon enr private key file.  (default ".charon/charon-enr-private-key")
      --publish-address string          The URL of the remote API. (default "https://api.obol.tech/v1")
      --publish-timeout duration        Timeout for publishing a signed exit to the publish-address API. (default 30s)
      --validator-index uint            Validator index of the validator to exit, the associated public key must be present in the cluster lock manifest. If --validator-public-key is also provided, validator liveliness won't be checked on the beacon chain.
      --validator-keys-dir string       Path to the directory containing the validator private key share files and passwords. (default ".charon/validator_keys")
      --validator-public-key string     Public key of the validator to exit, must be present in the cluster lock manifest. If --validator-index is also provided, validator liveliness won't be checked on the beacon chain.
```

### Download fully signed exit messages for cold storage

Once enough operators have submitted their partial signatures for an active validator, you can use the `charon exit fetch` command to download the complete exit message to a file for safe keeping. This file can be given to a delegator who wants a guarantee that they can exit the distributed validator if need be.

```markdown
charon exit fetch --help
Fetches a fully signed exit message for a given validator from the remote API and writes it to disk.

Usage:
  charon exit fetch [flags]

Flags:
      --fetched-exit-path string      Path to store fetched signed exit messages. (default "./")
  -h, --help                          Help for fetch
      --lock-file string              The path to the cluster lock file defining the distributed validator cluster. (default ".charon/cluster-lock.json")
      --log-color string              Log color; auto, force, disable. (default "auto")
      --log-format string             Log format; console, logfmt or json (default "console")

      --log-output-path string        Path in which to write on-disk logs.
      --private-key-file string       The path to the charon enr private key file.  (default ".charon/charon-enr-private-key")
      --publish-address string        The URL of the remote API. (default "https://api.obol.tech/v1")
      --publish-timeout duration      Timeout for publishing a signed exit to the publish-address API. (default 30s)
      --validator-public-key string   Public key of the validator to exit, must be present in the cluster lock manifest. If --validator-index is also provided, validator liveliness won't be checked on the beacon chain. [REQUIRED]
```

### Broadcast a signed exit message

The `charon exit broadcast` subcommand can be used to broadcast either a signed exit message from a file that was downloaded via the `fetch` command, or it can retrieve and broadcast an exit message directly from the API.

```markdown
charon exit broadcast --help
Retrieves and broadcasts to the configured beacon node a fully signed validator exit message, aggregated with the available partial signatures retrieved from the publish-address. Can also read a signed exit message from disk, in order to be broadcasted to the configured beacon node.

Flags:
      --beacon-node-endpoints strings   Comma separated list of one or more beacon node endpoint URLs. [REQUIRED]
      --beacon-node-timeout duration    Timeout for beacon node HTTP calls. (default 30s)
      --exit-epoch uint                 Exit epoch at which the validator will exit, must be the same across all the partial exits. (default 162304)
      --exit-from-file string           Retrieves a signed exit message from a pre-prepared file instead of --publish-address.

      --lock-file string                The path to the cluster lock file defining the distributed validator cluster. (default ".charon/cluster-lock.json")
      --log-color string                Log color; auto, force, disable. (default "auto")
      --log-format string               Log format; console, logfmt or json (default "console")

## The `combine` command

### Combine distributed validator key shares into a single validator key

The `combine` command combines many validator key shares into a single Ethereum validator key.

:::warning
This command requires Charon to access the distributed validator's private keys, please use caution and keep these private keys securely backed up and secret.
:::

```markdown
charon combine --help
Combines the private key shares from a threshold of operators in a distributed validator cluster into a set of validator private keys that can be imported into a standard Ethereum validator client.

Warning: running the resulting private keys in a validator alongside the original distributed validator cluster *will* result in slashing.

Usage:
  charon combine [flags]

Flags:
      --cluster-dir string              Parent directory containing a number of .charon subdirectories from the required threshold of nodes in the cluster. (default ".charon/cluster")
      --force                           Overwrites private keys with the same name if present.
  -h, --help                            Help for combine
      --no-verify                       Disables cluster definition and lock file verification.
      --output-dir string               Directory to output the combined private keys to. (default "./validator_keys")
      --testnet-chain-id uint           Chain ID of the custom test network.
      --testnet-fork-version string     Genesis fork version of the custom test network (in hex).
      --testnet-genesis-timestamp int   Genesis timestamp of the custom test network.
      --testnet-name string             Name of the custom test network.
```

To run this command, one needs at least a threshold number of node operator's `.charon` directories, which need to be organized into a single folder:

```shell
tree ./cluster
cluster/
├── node0
│   ├── charon-enr-private-key
│   ├── cluster-lock.json
│   ├── deposit-data.json
│   └── validator_keys
│       ├── keystore-0.json
│       ├── keystore-0.txt
│       ├── keystore-1.json
│       └── keystore-1.txt
├── node1
│   ├── charon-enr-private-key
│   ├── cluster-lock.json
│   ├── deposit-data.json
│   └── validator_keys
│       ├── keystore-0.json
│       ├── keystore-0.txt
│       ├── keystore-1.json
│       └── keystore-1.txt
├── node2
│   ├── charon-enr-private-key
│   ├── cluster-lock.json
│   ├── deposit-data.json
│   └── validator_keys
│       ├── keystore-0.json
│       ├── keystore-0.txt
│       ├── keystore-1.json
│       └── keystore-1.txt
└── node3
    ├── charon-enr-private-key
    ├── cluster-lock.json
    ├── deposit-data.json
    └── validator_keys
        ├── keystore-0.json
        ├── keystore-0.txt
        ├── keystore-1.json
        └── keystore-1.txt
```

That is, each operator `.charon` directory must be placed in a parent directory, and renamed to avoid conflicts.

If for example the lock file defines 2 validators, each `validator_keys` directory must contain exactly 4 files, a JSON and TXT file for each validator.

Those files must be named with an increasing index associated with the validator in the lock file, starting from 0.

The chosen folder name does not matter, as long as it's different from `.charon`.

At the end of the process `combine` will create a new directory specified by `--output-dir` containing the traditional validator private keystore.

```shell
charon combine --cluster-dir="./cluster" --output-dir="./combined"
tree ./combined
combined
├── keystore-0.json
├── keystore-0.txt
├── keystore-1.json
└── keystore-1.txt
```

By default, the `combine` command will refuse to overwrite any private key that is already present in the destination directory.

To force the process, use the `--force` flag.

:::danger

The generated private keys are in the standard [EIP-2335](https://github.com/ethereum/ercs/blob/master/ERCS/erc-2335.md) format, and can be imported in any Ethereum validator client that supports it.

**Ensure your distributed validator cluster is completely shut down for at least two epochs before starting a replacement validator or you are likely to be slashed.**
