# Errors & Resolutions

All operators should try to restart their nodes and should check if they are on the latest stable version before attempting anything other configuration change as we are still in beta and frequently releasing fixes. You can restart and update with the following commands:

```shell
docker compose down
git pull
docker compose up
```

You can check your logs using

```shell
docker compose logs
```

    </summary>
    <p>
      An ENR is shorthand for an{" "}
      <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778">Ethereum Node Record</a>.
      It is a way to represent a node on a public network, with a reliable
      mechanism to update its information.
      <br />
      <br />
      At Obol we use ENRs to identify Charon nodes to one another such that they
      can form clusters with the right Charon nodes and not impostors. ENRs have
      private keys they use to sign updates to the <a href="https://enr-viewer.com/">
        data contained
      </a> in their ENR. This private key is by default found at <code>
        .charon/charon-enr-private-key
      </code>, and should be kept secure, and not checked into version control.
      <br />
      <br />
      An ENR looks something like this:
      <pre>
        <code>
          enr:-JG4QAgAOXjGFcTIkXBO30aUMzg2YSo1CYV0OH8Sf2s7zA2kFjVC9ZQ_jZZItdE8gA-tUXW-rWGDqEcoQkeJ98Pw7GaGAYFI7eoegmlkgnY0gmlwhCKNyGGJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQI6SQlzw3WGZ_VxFHLhawQFhCK8Aw7Z0zq8IABksuJEJIN0Y3CCPoODdWRwgj6E

    A good quality beacon node API is critical to validator performance. It is always
    advised to run your own beacon node to ensure low latencies to boost validator
    performance.
    <br />
    <br />
    Using 3rd party services like Infura's beacon node API has significant
    disadvantages since the quality is often low. Requests often return 500s or
    timeout (Charon times out after 2s). This results in lots of warnings and
    errors and failed duties. Running a local beacon node is always preferred.
    We are not yet considering increasing the 2s timeout since that can have
    knock-on effects.

    <code>RESERVATION_REFUSED</code> is returned by the libp2p relay when some maximum
    limit has been reached. This is most often due to "maximum reservations per IP/peer".
    This is when your Charon node is restarting or in some error loop and constantly
    attempting to create new relay reservations reaching the maximum.
    <br />
    <br />
    To fix this error, stop your Charon node for 30mins before restarting it.
    This should allow the relay enough time to reset your IP/peer limits and
    should then allow new reservations. This could also be due to the relay
    being overloaded in general, so reaching a server wide "maximum connections"
    limit. This is an issue with relay scalability and we are working in a long
    term fix for this.

    It's because both Geth and Lighthouse start syncing and so there's
    connectivity issues among the containers. Simply let the containers run for
    a while. You won't observe frequent errors when Geth finishes syncing. You
    can also add a second beacon node endpoint for something like Infura by
    adding a comma separated API URL to the end of{" "}
    <code>CHARON_BEACON_NODE_ENDPOINTS</code> in the docker-compose.yml.

    If you get the following error when calling <code>docker compose up</code>:
    <br />
    <code>
      Error response from daemon: error looking up logging plugin loki: plugin
      "loki" not found
    </code>
    .<br />
    Then it probably means that the Loki docker driver isn't installed. In that
    case, run the following command to install loki:
    <br />
    <code>
      docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki
      --grant-all-permissions
    </code>
    .
