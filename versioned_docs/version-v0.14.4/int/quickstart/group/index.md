# Run a cluster with others

There are two user journeys when setting up a DV cluster with others. Each comes with its own quickstart

1. The [**Leader** & **Creator** Journey](./group/quickstart-group-leader-creator) which outlines the steps to create a cluster configuration for a cluster to be later joined by others. 
    - In the **Leader** case, the person creating the cluster *will* be a node operator in the cluster. 
    - In the **Creator** case, the person creating the cluster *will not* be a node operator in the cluster.

2. The [**Operator** Journey](./group/quickstart-group-operator) which outlines the steps to join an existing cluster created by a leader or creator using the above process.
