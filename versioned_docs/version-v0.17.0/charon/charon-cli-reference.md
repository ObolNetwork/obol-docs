# CLI reference

:::caution

The `charon` client is under heavy development, interfaces are subject to change until a first major version is published. 

:::

The following is a reference for charon version [`v0.16.0`](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases/tag/v0.16.0). Find the latest release on [our Github](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/releases).

The following are the top-level commands available to use. 

```markdown
Charon enables the operation of Ethereum validators in a fault tolerant manner by splitting the validating keys across a group of trusted parties using threshold cryptography.

Usage:
  charon [command]

Available Commands:
  combine     Combines the private key shares of a distributed validator cluster into a set of standard validator private keys.
  completion  Generate the autocompletion script for the specified shell
  create      Create artifacts for a distributed validator cluster
  dkg         Participate in a Distributed Key Generation ceremony
  enr         Prints a new ENR for this node
  help        Help about any command
  relay       Start a libp2p relay server
  run         Run the charon middleware client
  version     Print version and exit

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for charon

Use "charon [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

## The `create` subcommand

The `create` subcommand handles the creation of artifacts needed by charon to operate.

```markdown
charon create --help
Create artifacts for a distributed validator cluster. These commands can be used to facilitate the creation of a distributed validator cluster between a group of operators by performing a distributed key generation ceremony, or they can be used to create a local cluster for single operator use cases.

Usage:
  charon create [command]

Available Commands:
  cluster     Create private keys and configuration files needed to run a distributed validator cluster locally
  dkg         Create the configuration for a new Distributed Key Generation ceremony using charon dkg
  enr         Create an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) private key to identify this charon client

Flags:
  -h, --help   Help for create

Use "charon create [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

### Creating an ENR for charon

An `enr` is an Ethereum Node Record. It is used to identify this charon client to its other counterparty charon clients across the internet. 

```markdown
charon create enr --help
Create an Ethereum Node Record (ENR) private key to identify this charon client

Usage:
  charon create enr [flags]

Flags:
      --data-dir string   The directory where charon will store all its internal data (default ".charon")
  -h, --help              Help for enr
```

### Create a full cluster locally

`charon create cluster` creates a set of distributed validators locally, including the private keys, a `cluster-lock.json` file, and deposit and exit data. However, this command should only be used for solo use of distributed validators. To run a Distributed Validator with a group of operators, it is preferable to create these artifacts using the `charon dkg` command. That way, no single operator custodies all of the private keys to a distributed validator.

```markdown
Creates a local charon cluster configuration including validator keys, charon p2p keys, cluster-lock.json and a deposit-data.json. See flags for supported features.

Usage:
  charon create cluster [flags]

Flags:
      --cluster-dir string                The target folder to create the cluster in. (default "./")
      --definition-file string            Optional path to a cluster definition file or an HTTP URL. This overrides all other configuration flags.
      --fee-recipient-addresses strings   Comma separated list of Ethereum addresses of the fee recipient for each validator. Either provide a single fee recipient address or fee recipient addresses for each validator.
  -h, --help                              Help for cluster
      --insecure-keys                     Generates insecure keystore files. This should never be used. It is not supported on mainnet.
      --keymanager-addresses strings      Comma separated list of keymanager URLs to import validator key shares to. Note that multiple addresses are required, one for each node in the cluster, with node0's keyshares being imported to the first address, node1's keyshares to the second, and so on.
      --keymanager-auth-tokens strings    Authentication bearer tokens to interact with the keymanager URLs. Don't include the "Bearer" symbol, only include the api-token.

      --split-keys-dir string             Directory containing keys to split. Expects keys in keystore-*.json and passwords in keystore-*.txt. Requires --split-existing-keys.
      --threshold int                     Optional override of threshold required for signature reconstruction. Defaults to ceil(n*2/3) if zero. Warning, non-default values decrease security.
      --withdrawal-addresses strings      Comma separated list of Ethereum addresses to receive the returned stake and accrued rewards for each validator. Either provide a single withdrawal address or withdrawal addresses for each validator.
```

### Creating the configuration for a DKG Ceremony

This `charon create dkg` command creates a cluster_definition file used for the `charon dkg` command. 

```markdown

      --withdrawal-addresses strings      Comma separated list of Ethereum addresses to receive the returned stake and accrued rewards for each validator. Either provide a single withdrawal address or withdrawal addresses for each validator.
```

## The `dkg` subcommand

### Performing a DKG Ceremony

The `charon dkg` command takes a `cluster_definition.json` file that instructs charon on the terms of a new distributed validator cluster to be created. Charon establishes communication with the other nodes identified in the file, performs a distributed key generation ceremony to create the required threshold private keys, and signs deposit data for each new distributed validator. The command outputs the `cluster-lock.json` file and key shares for each Distributed Validator created. 

```markdown
charon dkg --help
Participate in a distributed key generation ceremony for a specific cluster definition that creates
distributed validator key shares and a final cluster lock configuration. Note that all other cluster operators should run
this command at the same time.

## The `combine` subcommand

### Combine distributed validator keyshares into a single Validator key

The `combine` command combines many validator keyshares into a single Ethereum validator key.

To run this command, one needs all the node operator's `.charon` directories, which need to be organized in the following way:

```shell
validators-to-be-combined/
├── node0
│   ├── charon-enr-private-key
│   ├── cluster-lock.json
│   ├── deposit-data.json
│   └── validator_keys
│       ├── keystore-0.json
│       ├── keystore-0.txt
│       ├── keystore-1.json
│       └── keystore-1.txt
├── node1
│   ├── charon-enr-private-key
│   ├── cluster-lock.json
│   ├── deposit-data.json
│   └── validator_keys
│       ├── keystore-0.json
│       ├── keystore-0.txt
│       ├── keystore-1.json
│       └── keystore-1.txt
├── node2
│   ├── charon-enr-private-key
│   ├── cluster-lock.json
│   ├── deposit-data.json
│   └── validator_keys
│       ├── keystore-0.json
│       ├── keystore-0.txt
│       ├── keystore-1.json
│       └── keystore-1.txt
└── node3
    ├── charon-enr-private-key
    ├── cluster-lock.json
    ├── deposit-data.json
    └── validator_keys
        ├── keystore-0.json
        ├── keystore-0.txt
        ├── keystore-1.json
        └── keystore-1.txt
```

That is, each operator '.charon' directory must be placed in a parent directory, and renamed.

Note that all validator keys are required for the successful execution of this command.

If for example the lock file defines 2 validators, each `validator_keys` directory must contain exactly 4 files, a JSON and TXT file for each validator.

Those files must be named with an increasing index associated with the validator in the lock file, starting from 0.

The chosen name doesn't matter, as long as it's different from `.charon`.

At the end of the process `combine` will create a new set of directories containing one validator key each, named after its public key:

```shell
validators-to-be-combined/
├── 0x822c5310674f4fc4ec595642d0eab73d01c62b588f467da6f98564f292a975a0ac4c3a10f1b3a00ccc166a28093c2dcd # contains private key

└── node3

        ├── keystore-0.txt
        ├── keystore-1.json

```

By default, the `combine` command will refuse to overwrite any private key that is already present in the destination directory.

To force the process, use the `--force` flag.

```markdown
charon combine --help
Combines the private key shares from a threshold of operators in a distributed validator cluster into a set of validator private keys that can be imported into a standard Ethereum validator client.

Warning: running the resulting private keys in a validator alongside the original distributed validator cluster *will* result in slashing.

Usage:
  charon combine [flags]

Flags:
      --cluster-dir string   Parent directory containing a number of .charon subdirectories from the required threshold of nodes in the cluster. (default ".charon/cluster")
      --force                Overwrites private keys with the same name if present.
  -h, --help                 Help for combine
      --output-dir string    Directory to output the combined private keys to. (default "./validator_keys")
```

## Host a relay

Relays run a libp2p [circuit relay](https://docs.libp2p.io/concepts/nat/circuit-relay/) server that allows charon clusters to perform peer discovery and for charon clients behind NAT gateways to be communicated with. If you want to self-host a relay for your cluster(s) the following command will start one.

```markdown
