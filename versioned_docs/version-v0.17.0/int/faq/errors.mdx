# Errors & Resolutions

All operators should try to restart their nodes and should check if they are on the latest stable version before attempting anything other configuration change as we are still in beta and frequently releasing fixes. You can restart and update with the following commands:

```
docker compose down
git pull
docker compose up
```

You can check your logs using

```
docker compose logs
```

      <h4 id="what-is-an-enr">What is an ENR?</h4>
    </summary> 
    An ENR is shorthand for an <a href="https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778">Ethereum Node Record</a>. 
    It is a way to represent a node on a public network, with a reliable mechanism to update its information. 
    <br /><br />
    At Obol we use ENRs to identify charon nodes to one another such that they can form clusters with the right charon nodes and not impostors. 
    ENRs have private keys they use to sign updates to the <a href="https://enr-viewer.com/">data contained</a> in their ENR. 
    This private key is by default found at <code>.charon/charon-enr-private-key</code>, and should be kept secure, and not checked into version control.
    <br /><br />
    An ENR looks something like this: <pre><code>enr:-JG4QAgAOXjGFcTIkXBO30aUMzg2YSo1CYV0OH8Sf2s7zA2kFjVC9ZQ_jZZItdE8gA-tUXW-rWGDqEcoQkeJ98Pw7GaGAYFI7eoegmlkgnY0gmlwhCKNyGGJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQI6SQlzw3WGZ_VxFHLhawQFhCK8Aw7Z0zq8IABksuJEJIN0Y3CCPoODdWRwgj6E</code></pre>

      </li>
      <li>Run <code>docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/charon" obolnetwork/charon:latest enr</code>. This prints the ENR on your screen. </li>
      <li>Please note that this ENR is not the same as the one generated when you created it for the first time. This is because the process of generating ENRs includes the current timestamp.</li>

      <h4 id="beacon-node-API-flaky">My beacon node API is flaky with lots of errors and timeouts</h4>
    </summary> 
    A good quality beacon node API is critical to validator performance. 
    It is always advised to run your own beacon node to ensure low latencies to boost validator performance.
    <br /><br /> 
    Using 3rd party services like Infura's beacon node API has significant disadvantages since the quality is often low. 
    Requests often return 500s or timeout (Charon times out after 2s). 
    This results in lots of warnings and errors and failed duties. 
    We are working on an <a href="https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon/issues/960">issue</a> to mitigate against this, but running a local beacon node is still always preferred. We are not yet considering increasing the 2s timeout since that can have knock-on effects.

          <code>Reserve relay circuit: reservation failed</code> error
        </h4>
      </summary>
      <code>RESERVATION_REFUSED</code> is returned by the libp2p relay when some maximum limit has been reached. 
      This is most often due to "maximum reservations per IP/peer". 
      This is when your charon node is restarting or in some error loop and constantly attempting to create new relay reservations reaching the maximum. 
      <br /><br />
      To fix this error, stop your charon node for 30mins before restarting it. 
      This should allow the relay enough time to reset your ip/peer limits and should then allow new reservations. 
      This could also be due to the relay being overloaded in general, so reaching a server wide "maximum connections" limit.
      This is an issue with relay scalability and we are working in a long term fix for this.

		When you turn on the <code>--private-key-file-lock</code> option in Charon, it checks for a special file called the private key lock file. This file has the same name as the ENR private key file but with a <code>.lock</code> extension.
		If the private key lock file exists and is not older than 5 seconds, Charon won't run. It doesn't allow running multiple Charon instances with the same ENR private key.
		If the private key lock file has a timestamp older than 5 seconds, Charon will replace it and continue with its work.
		If you're sure that no other Charon instances are running, you can delete the private key lock file.
