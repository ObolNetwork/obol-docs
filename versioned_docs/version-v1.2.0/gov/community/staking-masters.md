## Achieving staking mastery

The Staking Mastery program is a carefully curated cohort based program designed to empower and promote individuals who are passionate about advancing staking adoption through research, development and/or education.

In ancient Greece, masters were esteemed for their expertise and their role as mentors. A master would guide an apprentice through rigorous training and intellectual development. They often performed research, led workshops, or built entire guilds. This master-apprentice relationship was fundamental to the transmission of skills and knowledge in ancient Greek society.

We're empowering the next generation of masters, the Ethereum Staking Masters. 

## How does it work?

1. **Apply:** For those who are passionate about advancing Ethereum staking adoption through research, development and/or education.
2. **Interview:** Outstanding applicants will be interviewed to discuss their unique skills and how those can be best applied to advancing Ethereum staking adoption.
3. **Lead:** Selected Staking Masters will lead a project of their choosing for the length of their cohort, with support and recognition from DV Labs.
