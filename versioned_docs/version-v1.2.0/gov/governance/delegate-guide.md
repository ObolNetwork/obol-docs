# Delegate Guide

## Delegate Rules of Engagement

This document outlines the expectations, responsibilities, and values that should guide interactions within the Obol Collective governance community, including the Obol Forum, Discord, and working group meetings. This Code of Conduct will be reviewed periodically to incorporate feedback and adapt to governance needs. Any changes require community approval through the governance process.

Please review these principles carefully to ensure alignment with the Obol Collective’s vision and commitment to a decentralized and sustainable ecosystem.

Please read the rules of engagement on the forum [here](https://community.obol.org/t/delegates-rules-of-engagement/206).

## **Governance Toolkit**

These tools or their uses may change over time as governance evolves. For example, additional user interfaces dedicated to governance may be developed. Likewise, while voting currently takes place on-chain through the Governance Contract, some successful votes are administered and implemented by the Obol Association, which should not be the case indefinitely.

Please see the toolkit on the forum [here](https://community.obol.org/t/governance-toolkit/207).

## Delegates’ Role in the RAF
The role of Delegates in the RAF is to allocate votes to projects that have made substantial positive impact on the Obol Collective’s Decentralized Operator Ecosystem. Vote allocation is proportional to the Delegates’ delegated power. To determine the funding amounts, the [quadratic funding](https://qf.gitcoin.co/) mechanism is used, to ensure a balanced and equitable distribution of influence.
