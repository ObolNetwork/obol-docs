# Create a DV With a Group

This quickstart guide will walk you through creating a Distributed Validator Cluster with a number of other node operators.

## Pre-requisites
- A basic <a href="https://docs.ethstaker.cc/ethstaker-knowledge-base/" target="_blank">knowledge</a> of Ethereum nodes and validators.
- A machine that meets the [minimum requirements](../prepare/deployment-best-practices#hardware-specifications) for the network you intend to validate.
- If you are taking part using a [DappNode](https://dappnode.com/):
    - A computer with an up to date version of <a href="https://docs.dappnode.io/docs/user/install/overview/" target="_blank"> DappNode</a>'s software and an internet connection.
- If you are taking part using [Sedge](https://www.nethermind.io/sedge), or [Charon's Distributed Validator Node](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/lido-charon-distributed-validator-node) (CDVN) starter repo:
    - Ensure you have <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">git</a> installed.
    - Ensure you have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/" target="_blank">docker</a> installed.
    - Make sure <code>docker</code> is running before executing the commands below.

## Step 1: Get your ENR

<Tabs groupId="Get-ENR">
  <TabItem value="CLI" label="CDVN">

In order to prepare for a distributed key generation ceremony, you need to create an ENR for your Charon client. This ENR is a public/private key pair that allows the other Charon clients in the DKG to identify and connect to your node. If you are creating a cluster but not taking part as a node operator in it, you can skip this step.

```shell
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node.git
# Change directory
cd charon-distributed-validator-node/
# Use docker to create an ENR. Backup the file `.charon/charon-enr-private-key`.
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/charon" obolnetwork/charon:v1.2.0 create enr
```
You should expect to see a console output like this:
```logs
Created ENR private key: .charon/charon-enr-private-key
enr:-JG4QGQpV4qYe32QFUAbY1UyGNtNcrVMip83cvJRhw1brMslPeyELIz3q6dsZ7GblVaCjL_8FKQhF6Syg-O_kIWztimGAYHY5EvPgmlkgnY0gmlwhH8AAAGJc2VjcDI1NmsxoQKzMe_GFPpSqtnYl-mJr8uZAUtmkqccsAx7ojGmFy-FY4N0Y3CCDhqDdWRwgg4u
```
:::warning
Please make sure to create a backup of the private key at `.charon/charon-enr-private-key`. Be careful not to commit it to git! **If you lose this file you won't be able to take part in the DKG ceremony nor start the DV cluster successfully.**
:::

:::tip
If instead of being shown your `enr` you see an error saying `permission denied` then you may need to [update your docker permissions](../../adv/troubleshooting/errors.mdx#docker-permission-denied-error) to allow the command to run successfully.

#### Prepare an Execution and Consensus client
Before preparing the DappNode to take part in a Distributed Validator Cluster, you must ensure you have selected an execution client & consensus client on your DappNode under the 'Stakers' tab for the network you intend to validate.
<p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              Login to the DappNode Interface:{" "}
              <a href="http://my.dappnode/dashboard" target="_blank">
                Dappnode Login
              </a>
              <img src="/img/dappnodeLogin.png" alt="Dappnode Login" />
            </li>
            <li>
              Click on the 'Stakers' tab on the left side, select an execution client (e.g. Geth) & consensus client (e.g. Lodestar) & click 'Apply changes'. This will start the syncing process which can take a number of hours.
              <img src="/img/SelectClients.png" alt="Select Clients" />
            </li>
            <li>
              Once the clients are finished syncing, it should reflect on your 'Dashboard' as shown below.
              <img src="/img/Dashboard.png" alt="Dashboard showing chains are synced and their status are healthy" />
            </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
#### Install the Obol DappNode package
With a fully synced Ethereum node now running on the DappNode, the below steps will walk through installing the Obol package via an IPFS hash and preparing for a Distributed Key Generation ceremony. Future versions of this guide will download the package from the official DappNode DappStore once a stable 1.0 release is made.
<p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Before installing the package, make sure you are installing the correct one, this depends on which network your creator configures the cluster on, Holesky or Mainnet. You can find the link to both packages below:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="http://my.dappnode/installer/dnp/holesky-obol.dnp.dappnode.eth" target="_blank">Holesky Repo</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://my.dappnode/installer/dnp/obol.dnp.dappnode.eth" target="_blank">Mainnet Repo</a></li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      Copy the latest IPFS hash from the release details dropdown.
      <img src="/img/DappnodeRepo.png" alt="Retrieve IPFS Hash" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Go back to DappNode Dashboard > Dappstore, select the 'Public' tab, and accept the terms & conditions before proceeding.
      <img src="/img/PublicTab.png" alt="Select Public Tab" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Paste the IPFS hash you copied from Github and click 'Search' (It may take a minute for the package to be found.) You will then be presented with the package installation page. Under the blue 'Install' button, click on 'Advanced Options' & toggle the button to 'Bypass only signed safe restriction'.
      <img src="/img/BypassButton.png" alt="bypass only signed safe restriction" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Click 'Install' & in the config mode page > select new cluster & submit. (if you already have the config URL, you can select URL option.)
      <img src="/img/InstallPackage.png" alt="Install Package" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Accept the terms & conditions and the install process will begin.
      <img src="/img/TermsAndConditions.png" alt="Accept terms and conditions" />
      <img src="/img/PackageInstalling.png" alt="Package Installing" />
    </li>
    <li>
      You should now be able to see the Holesky Obol package under the 'Packages' tab. Click on the package to see important details.
      <img src="/img/PackagesTab.png" alt="Go to packages tab" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Under the 'Info' tab, you will be see pre-generated ENRs, along with information such as the status of all five distributed validator clusters, their docker volumes & other menu options.
      <img src="/img/GetENR.png" alt="Get your ENR" />
    </li>
    <li>
      Select any of the ENRs listed that are not already in use. This ENR will be used in the next step.
    </li>
  </ol>
</p>
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="Sedge" label="Sedge">

#### Installing Sedge

First you must install Sedge, please refer to the <a href="https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/docs/quickstart/install-guide" target="_blank">official Sedge installation guide</a> to do so.

####  Check the install was successful

Run the below command to check if your have successfully installed sedge in your computer.
```shell
sedge
```

Expected output:
```log
A tool to allow deploying validators with ease.
  Usage:

  Use "sedge [command] --help" for more information about a command.
```

Create an ENR using charon:

```shell
# Use docker to create an ENR. Backup the file `.charon/charon-enr-private-key`.
docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/charon" obolnetwork/charon:v1.2.0 create enr
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

For Step 2 of the quickstart:
- Select the **Creator** tab if you are coordinating the creation of the cluster (this role holds no position of privilege in the cluster, it only sets the initial terms of the cluster that the other operators agree to).
- Select the **Operator** tab if you are accepting an invitation to operate a node in a cluster, proposed by the cluster creator.

## Step 2: Create a cluster or accept an invitation to a cluster

<Tabs groupId="Creator">
  <TabItem value="Creator" label="Creator" default>
    <h2> Collect addresses, configure the cluster, share the invitation</h2>
    <p>
      Before starting the cluster creation process, you will need to collect an
      Ethereum address for each operator in the cluster. They will need to be
      able to sign messages through MetaMask with this address.
      <i>(Broader wallet support will be added in future.)</i> With these addresses
      in hand, go through the cluster creation flow.
    </p>
    <Tabs groupId="Launchpad-other">
      <TabItem value="Launchpad" label="Launchpad" default>
        <p>
          You will use the Launchpad to create an invitation, and share it with
          the operators. This video shows the flow within the [DV Launchpad](../../learn/intro/launchpad.md)
        </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              Select <code>Create a Cluster with a group</code> then{" "}
              <code>Get Started</code>.
              <img src="/img/Guide02.png" alt="Get started" />
            </li>
            <li>Follow the flow and accept the advisories.</li>
            <li>Configure the Cluster</li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Input the <code>Cluster Name</code> & <code>Cluster Size</code>{" "}
                (i.e. number of operators in the cluster). The threshold will
                update automatically, it shows the number of nodes that need to
                be functioning for the validator(s) to stay active.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Input the Ethereum addresses for each operator that you collected
              previously. If you will be taking part as an operator, click the
              "Use My Address" button for Operator 1.
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Select the desired amount of validators (32 ETH each) the
                cluster will run. (Note that the mainnet launchpad is restricted
                to one validator for now.)
              </li>
              <li>
                If you are taking part in the cluster, enter the ENR you
                generated in <a href="#step-1-generate-an-enr">step one</a> in
                the "What is your charon client's ENR?" field.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enter the <code>Principal address</code> which should receive
                the principal 32 ETH and the accrued consensus layer rewards
                when the validator is exited. This can optionally be set to the
                contract address of a multisig / splitter contract.
              </li>
              <li>
                Enter the <code>Fee Recipient address</code> to which the
                execution layer rewards will go. This can be the same as the
                principal address, or it can be a different address. This can
                optionally be set to the contract address of a multisig /
                splitter contract.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <li>
              Click <code>Create Cluster Configuration</code>. Review that all
              the details are correct, and press <code>Confirm and Sign</code>{" "}
              You will be prompted to sign two or three transactions with your
              MetaMask wallet. These are:
            </li>
            <ul>
              <li>
                The <code>config_hash</code>. This is a hashed representation of
                the details of this cluster, to ensure everyone is agreeing to
                an identical setup.
              </li>
              <li>
                The <code>operator_config_hash</code>. This is your acceptance
                of the terms and conditions of participating as a node operator.
              </li>
              <li>
                Your <code>ENR</code>. Signing your ENR authorises the

            </ul>
            <li>
              Share your cluster invite link with the operators. Following the

            </li>
            <li>
              You can use the link to monitor how many of the operators have
              already signed their approval of the cluster configuration and
              submitted their ENR.

Once every participating operator is ready, the next step is the distributed key generation amongst the operators.
- If you are not planning on operating a node, and were only configuring the cluster for the operators, your journey ends here. Well done!
- If you are one of the cluster operators, continue to the next step.
## Step 3: Run the Distributed Key Generation (DKG) ceremony

:::tip
For the [DKG](../../learn/charon/dkg.md) to complete, all operators need to be running the command simultaneously. It helps if operators can agree on a certain time or schedule a video call for them to all run the command together.

2. Copy and run the `docker` command on the screen into your terminal. It will retrieve the remote cluster details and begin the DKG process.
   ![Run the DKG](/img/Guide10.png)
3. Assuming the DKG is successful, a number of artefacts will be created in the `.charon` folder of the node. These include:
   - A `deposit-data.json` file. This contains the information needed to activate the validator on the Ethereum network.
   - A `cluster-lock.json` file. This contains the information needed by Charon to operate the distributed validator cluster with its peers.
   - A `validator_keys/` folder. This folder contains the private key shares and passwords for the created distributed validators.

              To run the Distributed Key Generation ceremony using a DappNode, you must paste the cluster definition URL into the Obol Package interface. Go to the 'Config' tab, select 'URL' from the dropdown menu, paste the cluster definition URL you retrieved from the launchpad, into the validator `cluster-*`field which matches the cluster you took the ENR from. Example: If you picked ENR1 for signing, then you should paste the URL into Cluster-1. Finally, click the 'Update' button at the bottom of the page.

:::danger
Please make sure to create a backup of your `.charon/` folder. **If you lose your private keys you won't be able to start the DV cluster successfully and may risk your validator deposit becoming unrecoverable.** Ensure every operator has their `.charon` folder securely and privately backed up before activating any validators.
:::
:::info
The `cluster-lock` and `deposit-data` files are identical for each operator, if lost, they can be copied from one operator to another.
:::
Now that the DKG has been completed, all operators can start their nodes.
## Step 4: Start your Distributed Validator Node
With the DKG ceremony over, the last phase before activation is to prepare your node for validating over the long term.

<Tabs groupId="Full-Pre-Existing">
  <TabItem value="Full Node" label="Full Node" default>
    The <a href="https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node" target="_blank">CDVN repository</a> is configured to sync an execution layer client (<code>Nethermind</code>) and a consensus layer client (<code>Lighthouse</code>) using Docker Compose, further client combinations can be prepared using Sedge. You can also leverage alternative ways to run a node such as Ansible, Helm, or Kubernetes manifests.

<Tabs groupId="Docker-Helm">

  <TabItem value="Docker" label="CDVN" default>

:::info
Currently, the [CDVN repo](https://github.com/ObolNetwork/charon-distributed-validator-node) has defaults for the Holesky testnet and for mainnet.

Start by copying the appropriate `.env.sample.<NETWORK>` file to `.env`, and modifying values as needed.

```shell
# To prepare the node for the Holesky test network
# Copy ".env.sample.holesky", renaming it ".env"
cp .env.sample.holesky .env


# To prepare the node for the main Ethereum network
# Copy ".env.sample.mainnet", renaming it ".env"
cp .env.sample.mainnet .env


In the same folder where you created your ENR in Step 1, and ran the DKG in Step 3, start your node in the DV cluster with docker compose.

```shell

# To be run from the ./charon-distributed-validator-node folder
# Spin up a Distributed Validator Node with a Validator Client
docker compose up -d
```

:::warning

Do not start this node until the DKG is complete, as the charon container will interfere with the charon instance attempting to take part in the DKG ceremony.

:::

If at any point you need to turn off your node, you can run:

```shell
# Shut down the currently running Distributed Validator Node
docker compose down
```
You should use the Grafana dashboard that accompanies the quickstart repo to see whether your cluster is healthy.
```shell
# Open Grafana dashboard
open http://localhost:3000/d/d6qujIJVk/
```
In particular you should check:
- That your Charon client can connect to the configured beacon client.
- That your Charon client can connect to all peers directly.
- That your validator client is connected to Charon, and has the private keys it needs loaded and accessible.
Most components in the dashboard have some help text there to assist you in understanding your cluster performance.
You might notice that there are logs indicating that a validator cannot be found and that APIs are returning 404. This is to be expected at this point, as the validator public keys listed in the lock file have not been deposited and acknowledged on the consensus layer yet (usually it takes ~16 hours after the deposit is made).

 <TabItem value="Sedge" label="Sedge">

To prepare a Distributed Validator node using sedge, we will use the `sedge generate` command to prepare a docker-compose file of our preferred clients, `sedge import-key` to import the artifacts created during the DKG ceremony, and `sedge run` to begin running the node.

#### Sedge generate
With Sedge installed, and the DKG complete, it’s time to deploy a Distributed Validator. Using the `sedge generate` command and its subcommands, Sedge will create a Docker Compose file needed to run the validator node.
<p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The following command generates the artifacts required to deploy a distributed validator on the Holesky network, using Teku as the validator client, Prysm as the consensus client, and Geth as the execution client. For additional supported client combinations, <a href="https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge?tab=readme-ov-file#supported-networks-and-clients" target="_blank">refer to the documentation here</a>.
              ```shell
              sedge generate full-node --validator=teku --consensus=prysm --execution=geth --network=holesky --distributed
              ```
              You should be shown a long list of configuration outputs with the following endings:
              ```shell
              2024-09-20 12:56:15 -- [INFO] Generation of files successfully, happy staking! You can use now 'sedge run' to start the setup.
              ```
            </li>
            <li>
              Explore the config files.

              You should now see a `sedge-data` directory created in the folder where you ran the `sedge generate` command.
              To view the directory contents, use the `ls` command. 
              ```shell
              ls sedge-data
              > docker-compose.yml jwtsecret
              ```

            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>
#### Sedge Import-key

Use the following command to import keys from the directory where the `.charon` dir is located.
```shell
sedge import-key --from ./ holesky teku
```
#### Sedge Run
After confirming the configurations and ensuring all files are in place, use the `sedge run` command to deploy the DV docker containers. Sedge will then begin pulling all the required Docker images.

```shell

Given time, the execution and consensus clients should complete syncing, and if a Distributed Validator has already been activated, the node should begin to validate.

If you encounter issues with using Sedge as part of a DV cluster, consider consulting the [Sedge docs](https://docs.sedge.nethermind.io/) directly, or opening an [issue](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/issues) or [pull request](https://github.com/NethermindEth/sedge/pulls) if appropriate.

:::warning
Using a remote beacon node will impact the performance of your Distributed Validator and should be used sparingly.
:::
If you already have a beacon node running somewhere and you want to use that instead of running an EL (`nethermind`) & CL (`lighthouse`) as part of the example repo, you can disable these images. To do so, follow these steps:
1. Copy the `docker-compose.override.yml.sample` file
```shell
cp -n docker-compose.override.yml.sample docker-compose.override.yml
```
2. Uncomment the `profiles: [disable]` section for both `nethermind` and `lighthouse`. The override file should now look like this
```docker
services:
  nethermind:
    # Disable nethermind
    profiles: [disable]
    # Bind nethermind internal ports to host ports
    #ports:
      #- 8545:8545 # JSON-RPC
      #- 8551:8551 # AUTH-RPC
      #- 6060:6060 # Metrics
  lighthouse:
    # Disable lighthouse
    profiles: [disable]
    # Bind lighthouse internal ports to host ports
    #ports:
      #- 5052:5052 # HTTP
      #- 5054:5054 # Metrics
...
```
3. Then, uncomment and set the `CHARON_BEACON_NODE_ENDPOINTS` variable in the `.env` file to your beacon node's URL
```shell
...
# Connect to one or more external beacon nodes. Use a comma separated list excluding spaces.
CHARON_BEACON_NODE_ENDPOINTS=<YOUR_REMOTE_BEACON_NODE_URL>
...
```
4. Restart your docker compose
```shell
docker compose down
docker compose up -d
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::tip
In a Distributed Validator Cluster, it is important to have a low latency connection to your peers. Charon clients will use the NAT protocol to attempt to establish a direct connection to one another automatically. If this doesn't happen, you should port forward Charon's p2p port to the public internet to facilitate direct connections. The default port to expose is `:3610`. Read more about Charon's networking [here](../../learn/charon/networking.mdx).

If you have gotten to this stage, every node is up, synced and connected, congratulations. You can now move forward to [activating your validator](../running/activate-dv.mdx) to begin staking.
